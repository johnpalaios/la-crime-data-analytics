This repository contains the source code and the report for the semester assignment of the 9th semester [Advanced Topics in Database Systems](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3189) course.

We were assigned to create and benchmark 4 different types of queries on the Los Angeles Crime Dataset using the Apache Spark unified analytics engine, Hadoop Distributed File System for distributed storage and Hadoop YARN for resource management and job scheduling. 
- Benchmarked 4 seperate type of queries using different number of executors, using different Join Strategies etc. 
- Plotted and explained the results of the benchmarks in regards to the inner workings of Spark.
- Explored the PySpark API, Apache Spark Internals, how to manage an HDFS cluster and more.
